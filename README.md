# GoFish
Description of the Program:

This Python program simulates a simplified 2-player version of the classic card game Go Fish. Players take turns asking each other for cards of a specific rank (e.g., 7, Q, A). If the opponent has any cards of that rank, they must give them up, and the asking player continues their turn. If not, the player must "Go Fish" by drawing a card from the deck.

The goal is to collect sets of 2 matching cards (instead of the usual 4) to speed up gameplay. The game continues until all sets are collected or the deck is empty. The player with the most sets at the end wins. Players can replay the game as many times as they like.

Features:
Randomized card distribution
Automatic detection of completed sets
Support for replaying the game
Turn-based interaction using console input
Handles edge cases like running out of cards or empty decks
